# Project Title: Natural Disaster Management and Response System (NDMRS)

## Project Description

The **Natural Disaster Management and Response System (NDMRS)** is a centralized web-based platform designed to streamline the management of natural disaster events in Sri Lanka. The system enables rapid victim registration, efficient aid distribution, real-time volunteer coordination, and transparent donation tracking. By providing a unified platform, NDMRS ensures a faster, organized, and accountable disaster response mechanism.

Key functionalities include:
- Role-based user registration and login (Admin, Victim, Volunteer, Donor)
- Admin dashboard for managing disaster events, victims, resources, volunteers, and donations
- Victim disaster report submission
- Disaster event creation and monitoring
- Resource and donation management (add/update/allocate)
- Volunteer registration and task assignment
- Generation of reports and visual dashboards
- SMS/Email alerts for notifications

The system leverages a **RESTful API** backend to facilitate real-time data management, allowing faster registration of victims, quicker aid delivery, and transparent tracking of donations and resources. Volunteer coordination is optimized, and data-driven reports assist authorities in making timely and informed decisions during emergencies.
